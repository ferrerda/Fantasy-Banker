Fantasy-Banker
==============

Fantasy sports lovers

a centralized fantasy sports page that manages finances like a bank. This would work for any kind of fantasy sports games or even daily fantasy games. Can create pools for like world cups, NCAA tournaments, etc. There are too many to mention. Money would be put into your bank account (fantasy banker) and fantasy moves can only be made while money is in the bank. Players will never worry about when they are going to get their money because the banker will pay as soon as the game is over. Will profit off the interest that is in the bank and possibly in the future other ways of profit.
